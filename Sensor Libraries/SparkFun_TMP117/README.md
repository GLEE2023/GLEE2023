[*SparkFun High Precision Temperature Sensor - TMP117 (Qwiic) (SEN-15805)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15805)

The TMP117 is a high precision temperature Sensor with accuracy of up to +/-0.1 degrees celsius and an operating temperature range of -55°C to +150°C. It is NIST traceable and verified with equipment that is calibrated to ISO/IEC 17025 accredited standards. It has a very low power consumption with a supply range of 1.8V to 5.5V. 

The TMP117 address can be changed with an external jumper to 4 different addresses. There are 4 different conversion modes that it can read from, with continuous conversion, shutdown, and one shot conversion. There is also digital offset for system correction, programmable temperature limits, General-Purpose EEPROM, and selectable averaging.
